            Designed to help with debugging code in Chrome; 
            you can either open with f12 or inspect.</p>

           <p> Tabs: <br>
            Device toggle allows you to see what something 
            looks on a mobile platform,
            as well as a desktop.</p>

            <p>Console -- you can see errors printed out, 
                and see if there are problems, as well as 
                testing out code.</p>
            
            <p>Elements -- allows you to see the dom and 
                everything 
                on the page.</p> 
            
          <p>  Sources -- shows you what is loaded on the 
            current 
            page in the browser. ex: if a js file isn't 
            linked,
            you can see it missing in the sources page. 
            You can also 
            see code that is running. </p>

           <p>Application -- you can look at local storage; 
            if you cache anything, you can see those values
            using a key-value pari; and store variables in 
            the browser's memory for later on even if the 
            user closes the browser.</p>
