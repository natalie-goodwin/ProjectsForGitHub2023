            <ol> <h2>
                <li>dir: shows what is in current directory </li>
                <li>cd: change directory; type "cd" and you go to home directory; "cd .. " goes back a directory "cd NameOfProject" takes you to a specific folder</li>
                <li>mkdir: create a new directory; must include name for new directory you are creating.</li>
                <li>copy: creates a copy of a file or directory, or copies file or directory from one directory to another. f we are in a directory that contains a file named test.txt and we want to make a copy of this file and call it testcopy.txt, we can run 'copy test.txt testcopy.txt'. If we want to copy the file to another directory named Documents/Projects, we could run 'copy test.txt Documents/Projects'.</li>
                <li>move: moves a file or directory to another directory. This works similarly to copy in that it will move instead of copy a file. If we want to move a file named test.txt to a directory called Documents/Projects, we would run 'move test.txt Documents/Projects'.</li>
                <li>cls: clears screen</li>
                <li>del: deletes a file</li>
