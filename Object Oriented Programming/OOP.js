/*Object-Oriented-Programming: 
Most commonly used methodology for writing code 
throughout the industry; 

Objects have attributes that define them: 

DVD Player
---------------------
Height
Weight
Width
Color

Objects also have functionality: 
Play
Fast Forward
Rewind
Pause

These attributes and functionalities make up the 
description of the object (DVD player) 

An object can interact with other objects that have their 
own attributes:

DVD 
-----------
Movie Length
Image
Size

Code can be shaped in a maintainable way with OOP, when
we think of objects in relation to other objects 


4 main pillars of OOP:

Abstraction: hides complexity by giving a 30,000 foot view 
of a concept or object; all vehicles move, but may move 
differently; takes the concept of motion and says 
'A vehicle moves'
Encapsalation: hides how a method works; we have to know
how to drive a vehicle, but we don't have to know
what is going on under the hood
Inheritance: objects inherit properties and functionalities 
from other classes
Polymorphism: Something can take multiple different forms;
an animal communicates differently from another animal; each 
animal communicates, but in a different way from another 
animal and this is polymorphism


Classes can group code together in a logical way; 
an object is an instance of a class; objects can be created 
from classes; classes are blueprints for objects to be created
from and an object is an instance of a class.
