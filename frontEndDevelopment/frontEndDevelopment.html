<!--Front End Development: 
when we open a website or application we see a user interface: click buttons, 
see images and text fields, and interact with as users 
the user interface is the front end. Displaying of data, images, 
buttons, text fields, and calculations surrounding these items all happen on
the front end of the application. The user interface runs on the client's computer. 
The back end is the behind the scenes part users don't see. The frontend
sends requests to the backend when the user clicks a button to retrieve
additional data to display. When a user clicks a like button on the social 
media site, the frontend sends a request to the backend to ask for the data 
that describes all the users  being followed by the user who clicked the button
 and when the backend responds by sending the requested data the frontend 
 displays the data for the user to further interact with. Front End Development
consists of building a piec of an application that runs on the
user's computer, and is typically built out of html, css, and javascript-->

<!-- HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) is the skeleton structure, for a 
frontend application; it is the text on the screen. Elements are the building
blocks of HTML and help to structure and describe how to display content; html 
element have tags -- most open and close, but some are self-closing tags
CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) is the skin and clothing of the skeleton; it
adds style to the skeleton to make it look good. 
JS allows the skeleton to move with functionality and calculations

<!--HTML provides elements to structure our text: headings, paragraphs,
    and formatting elements-->
